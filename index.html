    <p>I was born in Los Angeles, but was raised in Mason, OH. I attended Walnut Hills High School, where I took my first programming class and learned Java. After that, I knew that it was what I wanted to do. I've also been to five different countries, my favorite being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain.</a> When I retire, I plan on moving to Europe and helping the less fortunate around the world.  </p>
